# CrabCamera Roadmap

CrabCamera is a production-ready desktop camera plugin for Tauri applications.
Its mission is **invisible camera infrastructure**: drop it in, it works.

## Current Milestones
- ✅ Cross-platform camera access (Windows/macOS/Linux).
- ✅ Professional hardware controls (auto-focus, exposure, white balance).
- ✅ Multi-camera support with device enumeration and format negotiation.
- ✅ Tauri 2.0 plugin architecture with comprehensive error handling.
- ✅ 63 comprehensive tests with zero unsafe code.

## Next Goals
- [ ] Real-time streaming capabilities with frame callbacks.
- [ ] Advanced camera controls (zoom, pan, tilt for supported devices).
- [ ] Video recording with codec selection and quality settings.
- [ ] Hardware-accelerated image processing (GPU filters, enhancement).
- [ ] Camera calibration utilities for computer vision applications.
- [ ] Batch photo capture with burst mode and bracketing.

## Long-Term Vision
- Complete desktop camera ecosystem for Tauri applications.
- Integration with computer vision libraries (OpenCV, Candle).
- AI-powered image enhancement and automatic quality optimization.
- Professional broadcast features (chroma key, multi-cam switching).
- Embedded device support for IoT and industrial applications.
- Plugin ecosystem for specialized camera hardware.

## Philosophy
CrabCamera will remain **free forever** under MIT license. Desktop applications deserve native camera access without web API limitations or mobile-only restrictions.
