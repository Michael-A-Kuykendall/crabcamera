## Known Limitations (NOT STUBS)

These are **documented design decisions**, not incomplete implementations:

### 1. Windows MediaFoundation Device Discovery
**File:** `src/platform/windows/controls.rs` line 509

**Status:** Intentionally returns error to maintain architecture
```rust
/// NOTE: This is currently a stub implementation. Full MediaFoundation device enumeration
/// requires significant COM infrastructure that is being deferred to Phase 3.1.
```

**Reason:** 
- Working architecture uses nokhwa for device discovery
- MediaFoundation integration is **Phase 3.1** (next phase)
- Device discovery IS working via nokhwa
- This is a planned enhancement, not broken functionality

**Action:** Phase 3.1 will implement full MediaFoundation controls

### 2. WebRTC Placeholder Frame Data
**File:** `src/webrtc/streaming.rs` line 195

**Status:** WebRTC module provides API structure
```rust
/// Current implementation provides placeholder frame data for API structure
```

**Reason:**
- WebRTC is **Phase 4.2** (future phase)
- API structure is defined and testable
- Real implementation deferred per roadmap

**Action:** Phase 4.2 will implement actual WebRTC encoding

### 3. Focus Distance Control
**File:** `src/focus_stack/capture.rs` line 57

**Status:** Documented requirement for platform-specific APIs
```rust
// NOTE: Automatic focus distance control requires platform-specific camera APIs:
// - Windows: IAMCameraControl::Set(CameraControl_Focus, ...)
// - macOS: AVCaptureDevice.setFocusMode() and lensPosition
// - Linux: v4l2 VIDIOC_S_CTRL with V4L2_CID_FOCUS_ABSOLUTE
```

**Reason:**
- Requires advanced camera control APIs (Phase 3.1)
- Current manual focus workflow is functional
- User adjusts focus between captures (using step_delay_ms)

**Action:** Phase 3.1 MediaFoundation will enable programmatic focus
